#Static Front-end
----

The code for the Static front-end is here. This is the same as found on http://dev.ashva.la/CsSocket

To setup, we will use Apache servers that come as part of most OS X versions and Linux distributions.

The instructions are as follows:

- On OS X, copy this directory to /Library/WebServer/Documents
- On Linux, copy this directory to /var/www/html/
- Copy the Csound PNaCl binary and related js files into this directory. (these are on Sourceforge, follow the instructions from the README there)
- Go to the server folder that came as part of this package and start the server
- Go to http://localhost/Static_Frontend
- Enjoy!
