###Introduction:

This is the example boiler plate code written for the paper of the same title, which is part of the 2015 ICSC proceedings.

All the server code can be found in the [server](server/) directory.

The Python front-end can be found in the [Python_Interface](Python_Interface/) directory.

The HTML front-ends are in the [Frontends](Frontends/) directory.

All the directories come with a README.md file that contains instructions on how to use them. 

### General Set-up: 

In order to get a good setup going, follow the instructions in the [Frontends](Frontends/) directory and deciding which of the two idioms you want to use - static or dynamic. Following which, go to your Servers directory and start the related server. 

For the python interface, it's recommended that you have the HTML interface up and running as this will make sound via Csound PNaCl.
